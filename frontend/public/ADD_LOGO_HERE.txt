⚠️ IMPORTANT: ADD YOUR LOGO FILE HERE ⚠️

To make the InterGuide logo appear everywhere in your app:

1. Save your logo image as: interguide-logo.png
2. Place it in this folder: frontend/public/
3. The exact path should be: frontend/public/interguide-logo.png

File Requirements:
- Name: interguide-logo.png (exactly this name)
- Format: PNG
- Recommended size: 512x512 pixels (square) or larger
- Background: Transparent background works best

After adding the file:
1. The logo will automatically appear on:
   - Landing page navigation
   - Login page
   - Signup page
   - Dashboard header
   - Browser favicon (tab icon)
   - Social media previews when sharing links

2. You may need to:
   - Clear your browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
   - Restart your dev server if running locally
   - Redeploy if on production

Current Status:
❌ Logo file not found - App is showing BookOpen icon as fallback
✅ Code is ready - Will use logo once file is added
